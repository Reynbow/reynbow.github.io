        <div class="my_head">Welcome to Idle Animation.</div>
        <div class="my_body"><br>We are an Australian gaming group, welcoming to all!<br><br>
        
        We have a small core team that is always looking for higher tier PvP and PvE players for things like Raids, comp, Trials (lol) etc... But this is not a requirement at all.<br><br>

        Most members are over 18 and we don't hold back in chat.<br>
        We're LGBTQ+ friendly and you will be kicked if you're not.<br>
        If you're looking for a kid-friendly clean chat, this clan won't be it.<br>
        If you're looking for a safe space, this is not it.<br>
        If you're looking for some bants, then this might be your place.<br><br>

        In saying that, we won't tolerate overt homophobia and racism etc.<br>
        If you're trying to be mean, that's one thing, if you're just having some bants, then cool.<br><br>

        We play exclusively on PC.<br>
        The only requirement is to be right here, in the Discord.<br><br>

        Just head to the #roles channel and add the roles to your account. You need to have at least one game assigned to you to be able to chat.</div><br>
