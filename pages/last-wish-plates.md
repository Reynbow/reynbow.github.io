<div class="my_head">LAST WISH - WISHES</div>
<div class="my_body"><br>To make a wish, you will need to go to the Wishing Wall. The Wishing Wall is located before the first encounter. Before you enter the door to start the first encounter, look to the left and you will see a small lake. Look for the green grassy patches against the cliff edges and follow them up. You will eventually make your way to a small room with a grid of circles against a wall. To change the symbol on the grid you simply shoot them and they will cycle through all the symbols. To confirm a configuration, walk on to the circular button in the middle of the room.<br><br>
        If you entered the combination correctly the symbols will flash white and fade away. If you entered incorrectly, the symbols will change red/orange and then fade away.</div><br>
